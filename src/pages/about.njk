I'm a product design generalist focused on great experiences and outcomes for both customers and the business. My process involves understanding customer and business goals via discussions and sketching out ideas with product owners. I then prototype, test and iterate based on feedback. I love discussing and testing with customers. Things I check for: is this useful, usable, understandable, accessible? I collaborate closely with Engineering and QA to build and test, then validate production versions with customers. Design isn't done until customers are getting their jobs done.

I have a varied background in designâ€“from founding a surf magazine to running production at creative agencies. I created <a href="https://keeptheapostrophe.com">keeptheapostrophe.com</a> with my father. I occasionally write about UX and other subjects on <a href="https://medium.com/@mattosurf">Medium</a>. I've also made a few <a href="https://olearystudios.com/paintings">paintings</a>. I'm inspired by the California coast and can often be found playing in the waves or with my family on the beach. Happy to chat anytime about product design, art, surfing, or the best food trucks in Santa Cruz!
