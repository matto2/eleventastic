<p>The Open Banking demo site was kind of like a side project within the greater Axway org. It was created by a small, collaborative, and cross-functional team led by Eyal Sivan (Mr Open Banking) and I was tapped to be the designer. The site features real APIs but with a made-up, representative bank. Out of the banks that have seen the site demo so far, 5 out of 5 orgs have signed up for an Open Banking POC using the front and back end that we built (but they'll be adding their own bank name and branding).</p>
